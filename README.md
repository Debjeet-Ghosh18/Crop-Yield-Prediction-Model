🌾 ML-Based Crop Yield Analysis and Prediction Model
📌 Overview

The ML-Based Crop Yield Analysis and Prediction Model is a data-driven system designed to forecast agricultural crop yield using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical crop data along with environmental indicators such as rainfall, temperature, pesticide usage, crop type, and region, the model predicts yield in hectograms per hectare.
